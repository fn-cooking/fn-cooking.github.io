# The New Rules

 1. Try to behave reasonably towards other channel members. Insults which are
    not taken in a friendly manner are probably not reasonable.
 2. While off-topic chat is not strictly forbidden, it should be at least
    tangentially related to food or cooking.
 3. While the channel is not strictly family-friendly, gratuitous talk of sex,
    violence, or other themes that would result in an age-restricted film rating
    should adhere to rule 2.

# The Old Rules Still Apply

 1. All trolling must be funny. The channel ops will be the final arbiter of what is funny.
 2. Pizza is thin. If the base is thick, it's not pizza.
 3. The preferred language of the channel is English. American is permitted but not preferred.
 4. EU Regulation No 1151/2012 applies within ##cooking. Those names which have protected status
    within the EU will always be held to refer to a product which fulfils those requirements.
