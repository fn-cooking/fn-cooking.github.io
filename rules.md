# The Rules of ##cooking

 1. All trolling must be funny. The channel ops will be the final arbiter of what is funny.
 2. Pizza is thin. If the base is thick, it's not pizza.
 3. The preferred language of the channel is English. American is permitted but not preferred.
 4. EU Regulation No 1151/2012 applies within ##cooking. Those names which have protected status
    within the EU will always be held to refer to a product which fulfils those requirements.
