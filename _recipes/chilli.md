title: Second Best Chilli con Carne in Glasgow
---

This excellent recipe came second in a local competition. It's quite involved
so it's worth keeping for a special occasion.

# Ingredients
* 700g pork ribs
* 700g oxtail
* 500g chuck steak
* 2 red onions
* 1 bulb of garlic
* 1.5 inch squared fresh ginger
* 4 jalapeños
* 3 tablespoons of sugar
* 2 Rich Beef stock pots
* 3 pints of water
* 2 cans of Guinness
* 2 cans of cherry tomatoes
* 2 teaspoons of mustard seeds
* 1 teaspoon of cumin
* 1 teaspoon of coriander
* 4 allspice berries
* oregano
* smoked paprika
* lime juice
* 1 pack baby sweet peppers
* 1 pack dried ancho chillies
* 1 tablespoon of honey
* 1 tablespoon of tomatoes purée
* 1 cinnamon stick

# Directions
Add the ancho chillies, the cinnamon stick, two teaspoons of paprika, one
tablespoon of sugar, the pork ribs, one can of Guinness, a pint of water, a rich
beef stock pot and salt to an oven-safe pot with a lid.

Put in the oven at 200 degrees for two and a half hours until fluid has reduced
by half and meat is falling off the bone.

In a pot, put the two onions finely diced with sunflower oil, then add the
jalapeños cut small. Once soft add the allspice berries (crushed) all the garlic
and the ginger chopped finely.

Whilst that is cooking, dry fry the cumin, mustard seeds and coriander in a pot
for a few minutes to release flavour, then crush with a pestle and mortar and
add to the pot with about two teaspoons of paprika and the peppers (chopped).
Allow to cook for around ten minutes.

After ten minutes add the other Guinness and stock pot, plus two pints of water,
the steak and oxtail. Cover and allow to boil for an hour and half.

After an hour and a half add the two cans of tomatoes and lime juice and let
boil for a further hour so the meat breaks down, and the oxtail meat falls off
the bone.

Remove the bones and the cinnamon stick from the pot in the oven then transfer
the contents into your pot on the stove. At this point add the honey oregano,
the rest of the sugar, some lime and tomato purée to taste.

Cover and cook for a further hour, then uncover and cook for a further 30 - 45
minutes reducing the fluid and salting as required.
