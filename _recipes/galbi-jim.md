# Main Ingredients
* 1.2kg beef ribs with bones, preferably chopped in cubic sizes
* 600ml beef or vegetable stock or water
	* *n.b. If you want your stew to be mild, go for veg stock. If you want it
	beefy then use beef stock, although the traditional recipe calls for water
	where stock is naturally created in the process*

# Sauce Ingredients
* 6 tablespoons of soy sauce (any variety, but I don't recommend typical
  kikkoman table soy sauce, because it's too sweet and lacks body)
* 2 tablespoons white sugar
* 1 tablespoons brown sugar
* 4 tablespoons rice wine, or any form of Asian cooking wine
* 2/3 tablespoons sesame oil
* 3 tablespoons worth of chopped spring onion (You can use leek, but due to
  leek's natural sweetness you'd want to reduce sugar then)
* 1.5 tablespoons of garlic (not powder, but crushed in jar is ok)
* 3 dried chilli, chopped
* Half onion, ground
* White pepper, ground (Black pepper is okay)
* 1 teaspoon of ground ginger is optional
* Choice of vegetables to go with, diced:
	* **God Tier**
		* Shiitake (No need to chop)
		* Daikon
		* Dried Date
		* Chestnut
		* Pine nuts (just a little)
	* **Regular**
		* Potato
		* Carrot
		* Onion (whole onion cut in half - not too much as it gets too sweet)
		* Pumpkin

# How to
1. Rinse ribs under the tap and let them steep in cold water for 2 hours
   (optional but recommended)
2. Blanch the ribs for 1 min, and rinse them with lukewarm water
3. Put all sauce ingredients in the blender, and blitz
4. Marinade the blanched meat for at least 3 hours, ideally longer
5. Add the ribs, stock and veg in pressure cooker, bring up to boil for 5
minutes, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 7 minutes.
6. After that, turn the gas off and let it joli* for next 15mins
   * *Joli is a Korean technical term to let ingredients cook in residual heat*
7. Remove the lid, and boil on a high heat for 1 min
8. Move to slow cooker and cook until desired texture is achieved
9. Serve with any starch of choice, short-cut pasta, any quality bread for soup
   and rice are recommended
