Linseneintopf is German for "lentil stew".

# Ingredients
for 3 portions:

* 1500ml water
* 300g pork belly, smoked
* 250g green lentils
* 1 stick leek
* 2 medium sized carrot
* some root celery
* 1 laurel leaf
* 1 stick lovage
* 120g German noodles (spaetzle)
* 1 tablespoon mustard, medium hot
* Broth
* Salt
* Pepper
* Vinegar

# Directions
Put the water into a pot over high heat and bring to the boil. Cook the belly
pork for 25 minutes, then throw in the washed lentils and cook for another 20
minutes.

In the meantime cut the veggies in small pieces. Add the herbs and spaetzle,
cook for another 12 to 15 minutes then add salt, pepper, vinegar (1 to 2
tablespoons) and mustard.

Take out the belly meat, cut off the fat, cut the meat into small pieces and
throw it back in. You can separately cook a few Wiener sausages and add.

The longer the stew is cooked, the better.
