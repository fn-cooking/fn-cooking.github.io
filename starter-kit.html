<h1>The ##cooking starter kit</h1>

<h2>Equipment</h2>

<p>You can spend an awful lot of money on kitchen equipment, and to a large extent
the more money you spend the better the kit you'll get. However, there's no need
to spend thousands in one go -- start with reasonably priced yet good quality
examples of the absolute essentials, then over time add pieces as and when you
need and can afford them. Start with the list below, and then build.</p>

<p>People in the channel will be able to provide no end of recommendations for
equipment at various price ranges. The important thing is to buy stuff that's
built well enough that you'll never need to replace it -- a Le Creuset or Staub
cast iron pot costs a lot, but it'll be used by your grandchildren. A cheaper
one, on the other hand, may wear out and need replacing in a few years.</p>

<h2>Pantry ingredients</h2>

<p>These are the ingredients you'll want in your store cupboard. It might look like
a lot to buy at one time, but these items are all shelf-stable and one bottle or
jar might last for years. These are the things that are used in a wide range of
recipes, and are difficult to substitute (or, sometimes, they are the
substitutes for other things).</p>

<h3>Dry spices</h3>

<p>For cumin, coriander and black pepper, don't be tempted to buy ready-ground.
It'll go stale and lose its flavour much faster than the whole spice will.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cumin (whole)</li>
<li>Allspice (whole)</li>
<li>Black peppercorns (whole)</li>
<li>Coriander seed (whole)</li>
<li>Hungarian paprika (ground)</li>
<li>Ginger (ground)</li>
<li>Cayenne (ground)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dried herbs</h3>

<p>These are the herbs that work best when fried. Others (tarragon, basil, parsley,
etc.) don't dry well, and should be bought fresh when you need them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bay</li>
<li>Thyme</li>
<li>Marjoram</li>
<li>Rosemary</li>
</ul>

<h3>Oils</h3>

<p>Three oils, for different purposes. There will be times when you don't want to
use olive oil -- sometimes its flavour is too dominant, and its smoke point is
too low for most frying.</p>

<ul>
<li>Big tin of decent olive oil</li>
<li>Bottle of peanut oil</li>
<li>Bottle of grapeseed oil</li>
</ul>

<h3>Salts</h3>

<ul>
<li>A box of kosher salt, or large crystal sea salt.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Vinegars</h3>

<ul>
<li>Red wine vinegar</li>
<li>White wine and/or cider vinegar</li>
</ul>

<p>Not as essential as the above, but still very useful:
 * Rice vinegar
 * Sherry vinegar</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous dried foods</h3>

<ul>
<li>A selection of dried beans -- pinto, haricot, black turtle and kidney beans
are a good start. Big bags of these cost next to nothing and last forever.</li>
<li>Mushrooms -- porcini mushrooms dry well, and pack an awful lot of flavour.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tinned foods</h3>

<ul>
<li>Whole tomatoes</li>
<li>Chipotles in adobo</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sauces</h3>

<ul>
<li>Worcestershire sauce -- Lea &amp; Perrins is the standard brand here</li>
<li>Thai or Vietnamese fish sauce</li>
<li>Soy sauce</li>
<li>Hot sauce -- a mild, vinegar-based one and as many hotter versions as you
like. Apart from as a table condiment, these are always useful to give a bit
more interest to casseroles, tomato-based sauces and anything else you fancy.</li>
</ul>
