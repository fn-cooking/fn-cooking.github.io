<h1>The Rules of ##cooking</h1>

<ol>
<li>All trolling must be funny. The channel ops will be the final arbiter of what is funny.</li>
<li>Pizza is thin. If the base is thick, it's not pizza.</li>
<li>The preferred language of the channel is English. American is permitted but not preferred.</li>
<li>EU Regulation No 1151/2012 applies within ##cooking. Those names which have protected status
within the EU will always be held to refer to a product which fulfils those requirements.</li>
