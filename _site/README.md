# jekyll page for cooking

to insert a recipe:
  
  1.  navigate to the `_recipes` directory. 
  2.  create a new `your-recipe.md` file and insert the following at the top(if more than one word use dashes `-`): 
  
       \---   
       title: Your Title  
       \---

  3. Once the new .md is committed, the recipe can be found at http://localhost:4000/recipes/your-recipe
