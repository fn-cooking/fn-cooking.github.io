# jekyll page for cooking

to insert a recipe:
  
  1.  navigate to the `_recipes` directory. 
  2.  create a new `your-recipe.md` file and insert the following at the top: 
  
       `---`
       `title: Your Title`
       `---`

        * (look at the markdown for other recipes for examples)

   3. Once the new .md is committed, the recipe can be found at http://localhost:4000/recipes/your-recipe
